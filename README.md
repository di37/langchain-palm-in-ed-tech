# Question And Answering System using LangChain, Google Palm, FAISS and FastAPI for E-Learning Company

We will be creating Question and Answering System using LangChain, Google palm, FAISS and FastAPI for E-Learning Company based on CSV file that includes FAQs of Codebasics - an E-Learning Company.

## Getting the API Key for using Google Palm

1 - Go the following site:

```
https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
```

2 - Create API Key in new project or use existing one. Save it in .env file.

## Getting started with the project

1 - Download dataset to the data folder:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codebasics/langchain/main/3_project_codebasics_q_and_a/codebasics_faqs.csv -O data/codebasics_faqs.csv
```

2 - Install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3 - Go through the notebook - `experiments_and_trials.ipynb` under `research` folder to get used to the libraries.

4 - Run the following command to start the server:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

5 - Now we can test it on Postman. If it answers questions related to given dataset, it will be good. Otherwise, we will need to check the prompt template defined in `constants.py` under 'utils' folder.

6 - Samples as follows:

7 - To shutdown the server - CTRL + C.
