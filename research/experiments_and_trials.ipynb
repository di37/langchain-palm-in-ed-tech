       " Document(page_content='prompt: What is the difference between Business Analyst Vs Data Analyst\\nresponse: While both business analysts and data analysts work with data, they have different focuses and responsibilities. Here are some key distinctions:\\n\\n1. Focus: Business analysts focus on the business side of things, such as business processes, workflows, and strategies. They use data analysis to identify business problems, opportunities, and solutions. Data analysts, on the other hand, focus on the data itself. They collect, process, and analyze data to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.\\n2. Skill set: Business analysts need to have strong communication, problem-solving, and strategic thinking skills, as they often work closely with stakeholders and decision-makers to identify business needs and develop solutions. They also need to have some knowledge of data analysis, such as data visualization and basic statistical analysis. Data analysts, on the other hand, need to have a strong foundation in data analysis and programming skills, such as SQL, Python, etc. They also need to have a good understanding of data visualization and statistical analysis to derive insights from the data.\\n3. Tools: Business analysts typically use tools like spreadsheets, business process modeling software, and business intelligence (BI) tools to analyze data and create reports. Data analysts use more advanced tools like statistical software, programming languages, and database management systems to collect, process, and analyze data.\\n4. Outputs: Business analysts typically produce reports, presentations, and recommendations based on their analysis of the data. Data analysts produce statistical models, visualizations, and reports to help stakeholders understand the data and make informed decisions.\\n\\nI recommend watching this video by Dhaval sir which explained more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sFRpbPKTG4&t=1s', metadata={'source': 'What is the difference between Business Analyst Vs Data Analyst', 'row': 50}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"prompt: Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?\\nresponse: Here is the brief explanation.\\n\\nSAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() compares the given period with the exact same period of last year as the name suggests. But it has a limitation like King of the chess board - it can go only compare 1 year backward for a given day, month, week, or quarter. If you want to go backward or forward or if you need to go 3 or 6 months/years/days you need to use DATEADD().\\n\\nDATEADD() is more like the queen of the chessboard. It is very dynamic as it compares a day, month, quarter, year, etc. over any specified no. of time period.\\n\\nPARALLELPERIOD() works exactly like DATEADD() but there is a minor difference. Parallelperiod() does not work dynamically like DATEADD().\\n\\nFor example, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous month's value for dates between 1/5/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare these 12 days with the entire previous month of April 2023 (1/4/2023 - 30/4/2023) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same days (1/4/2023- 12/4/2023).\\n\\nLikewise, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous year's value for dates between 1/1/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare this time period with the entire previous year 2022 (1/1/2022 - 31/12/2022) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same period (1/1/2022- 12/5/2022).\\n\\nRefer this thread for more info: https://discord.com/channels/1090613684163850280/1106528524023648326\", metadata={'source': 'Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?', 'row': 51}),\n",

However, you may be involved in designing the structure and schema of a database, as well as configuring and populating it with data.\\n\\nCreating a database usually falls under the purview of a database administrator (DBA) or a data engineer. These roles are focused on the technical aspects of database design, implementation, and maintenance.\\n\\nAs a data analyst, your primary responsibilities would typically include querying and analyzing data within an existing database, creating reports and visualizations to communicate insights, and helping to inform business decisions based on data analysis.
